A vaccine is a biological preparation that provides active acquired immunity to a particular infectious disease. A vaccine typically contains an agent that resembles a disease-causing microorganism and is often made from weakened or killed forms of the microbe, its toxins, or one of its surface proteins. The agent stimulates the body's immune system to recognise the agent as a threat, destroy it, and to further recognise and destroy any of the microorganisms associated with that agent that it may encounter in the future.

Indeed, this was all our generation knew about vaccines in particular. We never saw a major outbreak. We were vaccinated against Polio in early 2000s, but back then we were too young. All other vaccines we took as a child were merely preventive, there wasn't a major outbreak of those viruses. So all I remember is seeing advertisements of "Pulse Polio - Do boond zindagi ki" where Shri Amitabh Bachchan used to come on Television and ask people to get vaccinated, yes much like how it is now. The vaccination drive for polio virus began in 1985. India was declared polio free very recently in 2014. Which means last case of polio was found in 2004-05. To give a better perspective of numbers, that is a 30 year long fight. 20 years till the virus lasted after vaccination even began. Think how much time the first vaccine took to be available?

## Development time for Vaccines

If you remember the early days of the pandemic, everyone was confused. Even doctors did not knew what to do. This was once in a century event. Something of this scale was last witnessed in Spanish Flu about 100 years back. I remember reading a [world economic forum](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/06/vaccine-development-barriers-coronavirus/) report on vaccines in general which mentioned a timeline of about 10 years for a vaccine to be ready. And I was shocked. See this image:

In general vaccines are hard to make. According to Bill Gates, it's harder than making a Jet Engine, and I agree. Polio vaccine development started in 1930's. First candidates found in 1950's. Vaccination Drive in India started as late as 1985. And it still took 20 years for India to eradicate polio. There are still many countries on this planet who haven't eradicated polio yet. One of them is our not-so-friendly neighbour Pakistan.

## The tremendous speed of vaccine development

All this proved wrong. The first vaccine candidate derived from MERS did its first clinical trial and this was just few months after virus outbreak was declared. India did not even had 5000 cases back then. India began its first trial in AIIMS in June-July same year. This was the first time the pace of vaccine development was so rapid. Part of the credit goes to institutions like Oxford University, ICMR, NIV Pune and companies like BioNTech, AstraZeneca, Serum Institute of India, Bharat Biotech. Governments also streamlined this process and supported these institutes across the world.

We got our first vaccine candidate publish its phase-3 trial results in November 2020. We also realised how VC funded startups can also do miracles. Moderna, a VC backed company also completed their phase-3 trial around that time and published stellar results. Both of these are mRNA based vaccines. They don't contain any inactivated virus / its spike protein or anything as such.

I don't want to deep dive into how vaccines work and at the same time, I would not call myself to be completely competent to explain that. So [here is an amazing video about how vaccines work.](https://youtu.be/rb7TVW77ZCs)

A large part of credit of this speed goes to the breakthroughs made in the mRNA technologies. See [this video to understand what they are](https://youtu.be/mvA9gs5gxNY). mRNA vaccines are easy to produce at scale because the process of culturing the virus is removed. They are also more effective, as the body is fed exact instructions of how to produce the anti-bodies instead of the body's immune system learning to do it by looking at an inactivated virus. This is the reason why Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines give immunity after 7 and 14 days of second dose respectively.

But it's not just that. Although late to the party, vaccines like Sputnik-V, Oxford-AstraZeneca, ICMR-Bharat Biotech and others also joined the league in matter of months. Each vaccine is different : some use inactivated virus, some use its spike proteins etc. But everyone made it. Johnson & Johnson went as far as having a single shot vaccine, which in my opinion is a miracle!

## Logistics

Let us have a look at the major challenges faced by India in polio vaccination drive (Excerpt from [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse_Polio) wikipedia article.):

```
- Testing showed that three doses of vaccine was enough to protect children in developed countries, <br> but it became obvious that this was not enough in some areas of India. <br> The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare recommended eight to ten doses for each child.

- Children in some areas of India are weaker and often had diarrhoea, which reduced the efficiency of the vaccine. Open defecation, monsoon flooding, and a lack of water treatment made it easier for a child to swallow more polio virus. As a result, children with too few doses of vaccine were not fully protected and sometimes got polio.

- The eradication program therefore gave drops over and over again, to boost children's immunity higher and as a precaution against missed children. Few parents initially knew that the vaccination campaign was trying to eradicate the disease, so they did not understand the reasons for the increasing intensity of vaccination. The increasing frequency of the drops and cases of polio among partially vaccinated children, caused rumours that the drops did not work.

- On July 30, 2013 a nine-month-old boy from Navi Mumbai tested positive for vaccine-derived poliovirus (VDPV) type 2. This was the fourth such case recorded in the country in 2013.

- Many parts of India are remote and hard to access. People in some areas had had poor and caste-discriminatory treatment by government health authorities, which made them less willing to assist in the vaccination programme. The time demands of polio vaccination sometimes left health care workers with less time for other services. The absence of any free health services other than polio vaccination and contraception lead to rumours that the drops caused infertility.

- Rumours about vaccinations varied by area, but were clustered, so that there was a greater risk of a cluster of unvaccinated children. Some believed that vaccinating newborns, children who are ill, or previously vaccinated children was not safe; the last polio case in India was a girl who had not been vaccinated because she was sickly. There were also rumours that the polio drops were made from the blood of pigs, dogs, or mice, or from pig fat.

- Poor participation of doctors and nurses, difficulty in maintaining and procuring vaccine, difficulty in procuring vehicles, and a lack of support from community members have caused problems in the program,[8] as has fatigue at the length of the anti-polio campaign.

I know this was vague at the best. But I appreciate you reading this. Thanks for reading. If you would like to have a conversation about this, float some ideas, educate me about some pre-existing ideas, tell your experience, drop me an email ([hello@shreyasb.com](mailto:hello@shreyasb.com)). I will be very happy to talk about it.
