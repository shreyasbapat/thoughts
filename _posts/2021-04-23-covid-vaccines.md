A vaccine is a biological preparation that provides active acquired immunity to a particular infectious disease. A vaccine typically contains an agent that resembles a disease-causing microorganism and is often made from weakened or killed forms of the microbe, its toxins, or one of its surface proteins. The agent stimulates the body's immune system to recognise the agent as a threat, destroy it, and to further recognise and destroy any of the microorganisms associated with that agent that it may encounter in the future.

Indeed, this was all our generation knew about vaccines in particular. We never saw a major outbreak. We were vaccinated against Polio in early 2000s, but back then we were too young. All other vaccines we took as a child were merely preventive, there wasn't a major outbreak of those viruses. So all I remember is seeing advertisements of "Pulse Polio - Do boond zindagi ki" where Shri Amitabh Bachchan used to come on Television and ask people to get vaccinated, yes much like how it is now. The vaccination drive for polio virus began in 1985. India was declared polio free very recently in 2014. Which means last case of polio was found in 2004-05. To give a better perspective of numbers, that is a 30 year long fight. 20 years till the virus lasted after vaccination even began. Think how much time the first vaccine took to be available?

## Development time for Vaccines

If you remember the early days of the pandemic, everyone was confused. Even doctors did not knew what to do. This was once in a century event. Something of this scale was last witnessed in Spanish Flu about 100 years back. I remember reading a [world economic forum](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/06/vaccine-development-barriers-coronavirus/) report on vaccines in general which mentioned a timeline of about 10 years for a vaccine to be ready. And I was shocked. See this image:

In general vaccines are hard to make. According to Bill Gates, it's harder than making a Jet Engine, and I agree. Polio vaccine development started in 1930's. First candidates found in 1950's. Vaccination Drive in India started as late as 1985. And it still took 20 years for India to eradicate polio. There are still many countries on this planet who haven't eradicated polio yet. One of them is our not-so-friendly neighbour Pakistan. 



I know this was vague at the best. But I appreciate you reading this. Thanks for reading. If you would like to have a conversation about this, float some ideas, educate me about some pre-existing ideas, tell your experience, drop me an email ([hello@shreyasb.com](mailto:hello@shreyasb.com)). I will be very happy to talk about it.
