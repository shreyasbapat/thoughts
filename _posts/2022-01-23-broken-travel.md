Did you see this news?

The tourism industry is in shatters. With different nations having different quarantine mandates, COVID19 cases peaking in some countries, and varying vaccination requirements, it is next to impossible to travel currently.

Adding to this mess, I am glad to share that we have set an example for our future generations. We have demonstrated how selfish and how illogical one can become. We have shown that the world indeed is not a family and how "Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam" is nothing but a gimmick.

New "variants" or as WHO puts it, ["variants of interest"](https://www.who.int/en/activities/tracking-SARS-CoV-2-variants/) keep popping up across the globe. And we are doing nothing to stop it. The only way through which we can stop the virus from mutating is to vaccinate the whole population and then start living a normal life.

Look at the map below. The following map shows the number of COVID-19 vaccination doses administered per 100 people within a given population. Can you spot something odd? Can you find a continent with an anomaly?

## Gross Inequality with Vaccination



## A friendly note

If you feel you want to talk to me, for anything - venting out/just a casual conversation/whatever. I will be up for it. It has been a tough year. After helping some people in wave 2, I have realized that the value of life is much more than personal relations. So even if we have never talked, and you wish to talk and not be judged, I will be all in. Please [schedule a call with me](https://cron.com/shreyasbapat/d9373nz7)

I wish you all a very healthy and peaceful new year 2022.

This also is a reminder to myself that I should resume my monthly articles. So I think I will continue. Thanks for the support again.
