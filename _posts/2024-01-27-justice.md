> Who are you?

When you are asked this question, what will you answer? Perhaps you will tell
your name? Maybe you will tell them about your family, your birthplace, your
parents etc. Pretty easy right? Now answer this question:

> Where are you from?

What do you tell? India? Why?

Let's try to list down possible explanations :

1) Perhaps you were born in India?

2) Maybe your ancestors were born in India?

But is that enough? Since by that logic, all presidents of India up until
Smt. Droupadi Murmu, and all prime ministers of India up until Shri Narendra
Damodardas Modi were not Indian. As neither they were born in India (est. 1947 CE),
let alone their parents. But all of them were as much Indian or Bhartiya as you
and me. So, what makes you, me and all these people born before 1947 Indian?

I will very specific here: Having an Indian Citizenship does not constitute one being from India.

A person born in India who acquired US citizenship, will always be a US Citizen
originally *from* India. To take India out of their system in their lifetime
will be impossible in most cases. Their subsequent generations can drop India
from their identity, which is perfectly fine.

## What is India, that is Bharat?

So, lets come back to the primitive question of what is India? To successfully
answer that, we need to understand what is a nation / what is a country first.

Try defining a country in your mind. Is it just land? Is it just some 3rd
country (read Britain) drawing a closed shape on a map? Is it just a worthless identity
a lot of people associate them with? Is it just all people practicing a common language?
Is it people speaking common language?

It's actually none of them. All great nations have nothing of these in common. And often the
countries who define themselves based on these logics are do not end up doing well. Take our
beloved Pakistan as an example. What is Pakistan? It is a country created for followers of Islam.
What else? Nothing. Take examples of African countries : Random Europeans drew lines between them.
For example, Guinea, a country which requires a further question - which Guinea?  
As there are 5 countries with Guinea in their name. They all are different countries
but keep a common term Guinea in their name. Why?

### Identity and civilisation

You in some random moment of your life thought, Where does the term "India" or "Hindustan" come from?
A common working response is, it comes from Indus River. But don't you think Indus also sounds like an
English / Latin name.

Let's take a walk around what happened in the past. It all begins from a piece of land west of the
river Sindhu (now known as Indus).

This Sindhu river is very important for us. This gives rise to the Indus Valley Civilisation. A whole region was named after it, Sindh.
The people of Sindh are called Sindhis.
