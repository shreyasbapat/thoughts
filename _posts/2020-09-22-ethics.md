This blogpost is inspired by the tweet I saw just 15 mins before deciding to write this. Lex Friedman took to the twitter to express his rage on the current state of journalism in the United States.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Journalism is broken.</p>&mdash; Lex Fridman (@lexfridman) <a href="https://twitter.com/lexfridman/status/1308144408760651778?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 21, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

This is not something new.
