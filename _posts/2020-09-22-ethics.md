This blogpost is inspired by the tweet I saw just 15 mins before deciding to write this. Lex Fridman took to the twitter to express his rage on the current state of journalism in the United States.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Journalism is broken.</p>&mdash; Lex Fridman (@lexfridman) <a href="https://twitter.com/lexfridman/status/1308144408760651778?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 21, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

This is not something new. We see this everyday in India as well. There is no question whether this is true or not. This is true. Journalism, is broken from the very roots of it.

> Journalistic objectivity requires that a journalist not be on either side of an argument. The journalist must report only the facts and not a personal attitude toward the facts.

This is never the case. No mainstream journalism is unbiased. Some support leftist agendas, while others support rightist. All of that is fine as long as they are not on either side of argument. They are supposed to report the facts, they are not supposed to tell you their personal opinion and orientation towards those facts. While objectivity is a complex and dynamic notion that may refer to a multitude of techniques and practices, it generally refers to the idea of "three distinct, yet interrelated, concepts": truthfulness, neutrality, and detachment. And we see the absence of this objectivity in the journalism each and everyday. Neutralism is a joke, there are clear ties between journalists and political parties. Mind you, it's not just the one side of the political compass which is doing this. It is everyone.

This is not me speaking. This definition of Journalistic objectivity is picked from Wikipedia. These are the textbook definitions, which refers to how things should work in ideal scenarios. You can clearly see that none of this is followed. I can argue that journalism is more of a propaganda tool these days. And what do I mean when I say "these days"? Journalism has always been more or less the same. Earlier it was print media, then the radio, then the Television which still is there and now social media. Only thing that has changed is the ability to hack your brain. It is a lot easier to play with your psychology using social media than it is through Newspapers.

## Is this everywhere?

Let's not limit ourselves to journalism. Look around, find a job, go and look at the dictionary definition of the job and there is 90% chance that you would find astronomical difference between the definition and what actually is happening. A lot of you would argue that this is not applicable to tech domain, private jobs.
