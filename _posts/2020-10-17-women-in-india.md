"India is a growth Story" - If you are aware enough, you would believe this to be true. If not, you might have at-least heard about it in some talk about India, some article in some newspaper. If not, go and see the statistics. Post the 1991 economic reforms, we have tried to adapt to capitalism. What used to be an economy with 2-3% growth rate, it became an economic powerhouse on the global stage. It earned the moniker of the world’s fastest-growing major economy in 2017, maintaining GDP growth above 7% p.a. since 2011-12.

Today, if we don't see a 7% GDP growth rate, we start blaming the economic policies of the government. We are hungry for the economic growth. A lot of focus is in that area. No matter what you feel about the current government, no matter if we witness a negative growth rate which is in fact the 6th time it's happening (Earlier contractions were in FY-1958, FY-1966, FY-1967, FY-1973 and FY-1980), we all know we will still grow. We will keep growing for at least next 30-40 years. This projected ~10% contraction is in fact not a big surprise. Our growth rate is skewed, we largely depend on services. And there is a trend which is worrying. If you look at the figures in the chart below, you will see that as time passes, we are increasing our dependence on services.

We have all heard that India is an agricultural country. This is indeed a false statement in current context. Contribution of Industries in Indian GDP figures has declined from 31% in 2009 to 24.88% in 2019. DO NOT confuse it with contraction of industries in India. In 2009, India's Nominal GDP was $1.341 Trillion, 31% of that will be around $0.416 Trillion. At the same time, in 2019, India's Nominal GDP was $2.875 Trillion, 24.88% of that comes out to be $0.715 Trillion.

So you see, there is growth, but the growth of service sector outperforms it. And not just that, growth of agricultural sector is also less than the national average. So what makes India a growth story?

## Indian Growth Conundrum

Take a wild guess of the growth rate of Agriculture sector of India. We call ourselves a country of farmers. I will give you a discount, guess the number from 2017, when the economy was strongest ever. Do you have a number in mind?

Okay, hold your breath. Here comes the number. Government of India states this in a [report by Ministry of Finance](http://mofapp.nic.in:8080/economicsurvey/pdf/001-027_Chapter_01_Economic_Survey_2017-18.pdf) and I quote:

> This is on account of lower growth in ‘Agriculture & allied’, and ‘Industry’ sector, which are expected to grow at 2.1 per cent and 4.4 per cent respectively. In 2017-18, service sector is expected to grow at 8.3 per cent, as compared to 7.7 per cent in  2016-17. Within the services sector, only the growth of ‘Public administration, defence & other services’ sector is expected to decline in 2017-18.

It is 2.2% at it's best. In tight years, it goes below 2%. At the same time, Industry sector grows at 4.4% (at it's best). These  numbers look like the pre-liberalisation era. Also look at how sharply the services sector is growing, and the only sub-sector that does not grow in services is the **Public administration, defence & other services**. And it's all from the Government of India report, I am not under/over stating anything.

With such an enormous dependence on Services Sector (which was the major victim of the COVID19 caused depression), it was indeed visible from the very beginning that there will be a major depression.

## Is it all bad?

NO!

There's no better answer. Last 2 months have seen two Indian startups cross $1 Billion Valuation mark. India saw a gigantic VC funding in September. Over $1.5 Billion was pumped in several Indian startups by a range of Venture Capitalists and Angel Investors.

Future looks a little bit hazy. I can not say where we are heading. But I think there is one data point which we all are overlooking. I recently listened to a podcast by Kunal Shah, the founder of CRED, where he mentioned a point about Indian Urban Labour Force.

## The Sham

After looking at the growth figures, we feel positive. For those of us who have studied economics, we know it's just a demand-supply game.

But do you know why we are not usually able to instil demand in our economy? That is because the services sector, which is mostly an urban business, and where only 30% Indians are working is mostly patriarchal.

Yes! I know you are questioning all the events that happened in the placements of your college, how females were ostensibly preferred over male candidates. I know you are questioning all the female hiring that several companies do. But let's stop for a moment and keep all our prejudices aside, keep all our assumptions, excuses aside and look at the data.
